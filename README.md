In today's sustainability-driven world, electric vehicles play a significant role. However, the performance and range of electric vehicles depend on effective and efficient battery management systems. Electric vehicle battery management is a crucial aspect of their daily use.

Battery management involves monitoring and controlling the battery's charge level, temperature, voltage values, and other critical parameters. This control is essential for optimizing the vehicle's range, extending battery life, and improving energy efficiency.

Firstly, the battery management system must accurately track the battery's state of charge. Monitoring the charge level provides users with real-time information and ensures accurate range calculations. This enables electric vehicle users to have increased reliability and better range estimations.

Secondly, battery management should track the battery's temperature. Temperature control has a direct impact on battery performance and lifespan. A robust battery management system ensures the battery operates within the optimal temperature range and takes necessary precautions in cases of overheating or extreme cooling.

Additionally, battery management should monitor the battery's voltage values. Voltage fluctuations provide insights into battery health and performance. This information can be utilized for battery protection, balancing, and enhancing efficiency.

Electric vehicle battery management is becoming increasingly advanced through cutting-edge technologies and data analytics. Artificial intelligence and machine learning, for example, can make battery management more effective and optimized. As a result, electric vehicles can benefit from increased range, extended battery life, and improved energy efficiency.

Efficient battery management plays a vital role in promoting the adoption and widespread use of electric vehicles. It enhances user experience, reduces range anxiety, and contributes to a more sustainable transportation ecosystem.

## Algorithm

- Start
- Initialize batteryLevel = 0 and mileage = 0
- On click of the "Charge" button:
- If batteryLevel < 100:
- Increase batteryLevel by 10
- Update batteryLevel
- On click of the "Discharge" button:
- If batteryLevel > 0:
- Decrease batteryLevel by 5
- Update batteryLevel
- On click of the "Drive" button:
- Get the distance from the distanceInput
- Calculate batteryUsage = Math.floor(distance / 10) * 5
- If batteryLevel >= batteryUsage:
- Decrease batteryLevel by batteryUsage
- Increase mileage by distance
- Update batteryLevel
- Update mileage
- If batteryLevel < batteryUsage:
- Show message "Insufficient battery level! Please charge."
